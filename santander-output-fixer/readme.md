Because Santander bank is rubbish with providing a customer who isn't using Excel with a useful export file I have created a simple script that will remove all the fluff from their export file and save it as a new file. 

Things that this tool removes are 'Â£' symbols so not every value shows up as a word and allows a user to use sum() and count() funtions in google sheets. 

## Warhing this can be easily broken if santander decide to change the layout of their documents.
